Title: Generates Synthetic EMS Patient Care Records in NEMSIS 3.5 format
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Samuel Kordik
Maintainer: Samuel Kordik <samuel@samuelkordik.com>
Description: Generates synthetic (entirely false) EMS patient care record data in 
    NEMSIS 3.5 format, which is useful for demonstrating analysis approaches,
    teaching data analytics techniques, or providing example data. Since most EMS
    data contains PHI or is otherwise proprietary and private, this is useful for
    providing completely clean, fake data that still makes some notional sense.
